# Linearity correction

### Data acquisition

### Data process
- Normalize
  - 1
  - 2
- Multiply by 100  
- Ascii data export
- Polynomial fitting (gnuplot)  
  - Open gnuplot  
  - Go to the directory that contains the data
  - Here, we assume that the data consists of texts of 100 rows, and each row contains 4 columns.
    

### Pulse programming


```
f(x)=a0+a1*x+a2*x**2+a3*x**3+a4*x**4+a5*x**5
a0=0.1
a1=0.001
a2=0.001
a3=0.001
a4=0.001
a5=0.001
```
