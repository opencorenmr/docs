# Getting Started with a 5 mm CPMAS probe

We assume that you alrerady have a system that works. That is, we assume that you have a system composed of an Opencore NMR spectrometer, a magnet, a probe, power amplifiers, a low-noise amplifier, and so on.

### A single-pulse <sup>79</sup>Br experiment in KBr
-  Rotor ID: 33L1012 (KBr 50 mg, adamantane 48.6 mg mixture)

##### Finding the right condition
- Frequency:  
- Sample position (how far you insert the probe into the magnet bore)
- Amplitude of the rf pulse and its optimal duration

##### Adjustment of the magic angle
